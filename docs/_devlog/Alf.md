# Devlog

## Todo

Build now uses the new API from SP:
That is the rest of the old config:

```php
'entity_files' => [
    'config/publish-item.php',
    'database/factories/PublishItemFactory.php',
    'database/migrations/create_publish_items_table.php.stub',
    'resources/lang/*/translations.php',
    'src/PublishItemPlugin.php',
    'src/Models/PublishItem.php',
    'src/Resources/PublishItemResource.php',
    'src/Resources/PublishItemResource\Pages\CreatePublishItem.php',
    'src/Resources/PublishItemResource\Pages\EditPublishItem.php',
    'src/Resources/PublishItemResource\Pages\ListPublishItems.php',
    'src/Resources/PublishItemResource\Pages\ViewPublishItem.php',
    // TODO: Add RelationManager, if exists
],
```

    -   [ ] with new base classes

    -   [ ] Ask category, must be an enum in core, I guess
    -   [ ] Ask parent-theme, must use package service, only for themes
    -   [ ] Do not copy composer.lock, vendor or build.php
    -   [ ] Do all in config, try first to port skeleton
    -   [ ] then simple and nested taxonomy
    -   [ ] then create items with relation
    -   [ ] then create module
    -   [ ] then copy theme
    -   [ ] find MSP only in /packages, not Skeleton
    -   [ ] Wire locally
    -   [ ] Finalize
-   [ ] Web: Skipping data: no composer.json found or invalid
-   [ ] Web: Skipping localization: no composer.json found or invalid
-   [ ] See Lunar and Filament before doing commands
    -   [ ] Refactor traits to Has and Can, see Filament
    -   [ ] Install filament with our own user, see Lunar
    -   [ ] Add our own Panels, not the default from Filament
-   [ ] Global Installer - feature/installer
    -   [ ] Need another test, not audit
    -   [ ] But if a plugin fails, it should just turn red, not fail, so audit is good for that
    -   [ ] We need to find all dependencies, all Laravel, all with migrations and seeders
    -   [ ] We need to check for Filament (e. g. canAccessPanel and isSuperAdmin, see [here](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/installation#deploying-to-production))
    -   [ ] Packages might need an installer class? What needs to be installed?
        -   [x] Migrations and seeders
        -   [ ] Needed Configuration?
        -   [ ] Needed Assets?

        -   [ ] Description, Image are suggested
        -   [ ] Color is optional
        -   [ ] Identify and delete in migration, model, resource
    -   [ ] Use all available Entities to copy
        -   [ ] From config to composer.json
        -   [ ] We now know the Entities
        -   [ ] config can now define "most wanted"
    -   [ ] Wire Themes, test one component renderless, then styled
    -   [ ] Implement Theme Hierarchy in MooxService Provider
    -   [ ] Document implementation

        -   [ ] Moox Version
        -   [ ] Moox Packages loaded
        -   [ ] Moox Packages installed
        -   [ ] Moox Packages need db update
        -   [ ] Devlink Status / Tables need verbose
    -   [ ] moox:wire - connect relations, taxonomies and modules
    -   [ ] moox:scaffold - change fields of an entity by a config or JSON
    -   [ ] moox:release or UI - auto release, see notes
        -   [ ] We need to see if we use moox.json, DB or both.

## Relations

-   I ship with polymorphic support, rarely used in Moox, but not much overhead
-   I use a Stub Model in Core as Default Placeholder when `/** @var \App\Models\Product $product */` does not already fix the problem
-   I may provide **helper functions like `Moox::getItemConfig('Product')`**, which abstracts the complexity and makes it feel **Laravel-native**. But my focus is on the Filament layer, I might not need.
-   I could use:
    `composer require --dev barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper`
    `php artisan ide-helper:models`
    but why should I, when the problem is fixed without ;-)

```php
return [
	"relations" => [
		"RelatedItem"
	],
	"taxonomies" => [
		"Category",
		"Tag"
	],
	"modules" => [
		"MoreItemFields"
	],

],
```

## Workflows

Workflows would be a thing, I guess, a mix of Action, Trigger, Mailable in this case:

```php
return [
    "workflows" => [
        "StockUpdate" => [
            "applies_to" => ["Product"],
            "event" => "updated",
            "handler" => StockUpdateWorkflow::class
        ],
        "SendNewUserEmail" => [
            "applies_to" => ["User"],
            "event" => "created",
            "handler" => SendWelcomeEmailWorkflow::class
        ]
    ]
];

```

## moox.json

Done by DB now, for release, but moox.json should be generated (with features, capabilities, ships, models, workflows, jobs, mails, classes for the rest..

```json
{
    "current": {
        "release": "4.1.2",
        "capabilities": ["This is a main feature"],
        "features": ["This is a feature"],
        "classes": ["This is a class"],
        "models": ["This is a model"],
        "resources": ["This is a resource"],
        "routes": ["This is a route"],
        "views": ["This is a view"]
    },
    "next": {
        "release": "4.2.0", // by release command
        "capabilities": ["This is a main feature"],
        "features": ["This is a feature"],
        "fixes": ["This is a commit message"],
        "classes": [
            "This is a class" // if changes
        ]
    }
}
```

## Auto Release

The title of a commit message or pull request is tracked. This is now done by simple Keywords - and please note the :

Fix: Changed visibility of something
Feature: New Upload-Section
Capability: Great things will happen

CI tracks affected packages.

The result is collected into a json file:

-   all
    -   Mayor: Great things will happen
-   core
    -   Fix: Changed visibility of something
    -   Feature: New Upload-Section
-   press
    -   ...
