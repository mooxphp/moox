    -   [ ] HasScheduledPublish Trait docs
-   [ ] Build should replace with variables, not the placeholders
-   [ ] Build must use the entity files for entity generation
-   [ ] Implement Frontend class, abstract? See Frontend/Idea.md
-   [ ] Build Skeleton -> Item
-   [ ] Refactor core traits to base classes
-   [ ] Build ...
    -   [ ] Ask category, must be an enum in core, I guess
    -   [ ] Ask parent-theme, must use package service, only for themes
    -   [ ] Do not copy composer.lock, vendor or build.php
    -   [ ] Do all in config, try first to port skeleton

-   [ ] Global Installer - feature/installer
    -   [ ] Need another test, not audit
    -   [ ] But if a plugin fails, it should just turn red, not fail, so audit is good for that
    -   [ ] We need to find all dependencies, all Laravel, all with migrations and seeders
    -   [ ] We need to check for Filament (e. g. canAccessPanel and isSuperAdmin, see [here](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/installation#deploying-to-production))
    -   [ ] Packages might need an installer class? What needs to be installed?

## Relations

-   I ship with polymorphic support, rarely used in Moox, but not much overhead
-   I use a Stub Model in Core as Default Placeholder when `/** @var \App\Models\Product $product */` does not already fix the problem
-   I may provide **helper functions like `Moox::getItemConfig('Product')`**, which abstracts the complexity and makes it feel **Laravel-native**. But my focus is on the Filament layer, I might not need.
-   I could use:
    `composer require --dev barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper`
    `php artisan ide-helper:models`
    but why should I, when the problem is fixed without ;-)

```php
return [
	"relations" => [
		"RelatedItem"
	],
	"taxonomies" => [
		"Category",
		"Tag"
	],
	"modules" => [
		"MoreItemFields"
	],

],
```

## Workflows

Workflows would be a thing, I guess, a mix of Action, Trigger, Mailable in this case:

```php
return [
    "workflows" => [
        "StockUpdate" => [
            "applies_to" => ["Product"],
            "event" => "updated",
            "handler" => StockUpdateWorkflow::class
        ],
        "SendNewUserEmail" => [
            "applies_to" => ["User"],
            "event" => "created",
            "handler" => SendWelcomeEmailWorkflow::class
        ]
    ]
];

```

## moox.json

Done by DB now, for release, but moox.json should be generated (with features, capabilities, ships, models, workflows, jobs, mails, classes for the rest..

```json
{
    "current": {
        "release": "4.1.2",
        "capabilities": ["This is a main feature"],
        "features": ["This is a feature"],
        "classes": ["This is a class"],
        "models": ["This is a model"],
        "resources": ["This is a resource"],
        "routes": ["This is a route"],
        "views": ["This is a view"]
    },
    "next": {
        "release": "4.2.0", // by release command
        "capabilities": ["This is a main feature"],
        "features": ["This is a feature"],
        "fixes": ["This is a commit message"],
        "classes": [
            "This is a class" // if changes
        ]
    }
}
```

## Auto Release

The title of a commit message or pull request is tracked. This is now done by simple Keywords - and please note the :

Fix: Changed visibility of something
Feature: New Upload-Section
Capability: Great things will happen

CI tracks affected packages.

The result is collected into a json file:

-   all
    -   Mayor: Great things will happen
-   core
    -   Fix: Changed visibility of something
    -   Feature: New Upload-Section
-   press
    -   ...
