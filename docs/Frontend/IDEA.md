# Idea

What should it do?

-   Provide automatic frontend routing for resources
-   Provide Preview feature so that we can see unpublished or deleted resources using temporary urls behind login
-   Moox Packages with Frontend require Moox Frontend
-   Resources must provide a Frontend configuration, including a theme
-   Frontend uses Moox Themes
-   Caching

Pro

-   Static HTML
-   Publishing on CDN
