# Roadmap

## Current tasks

-   [ ] Private packages are not yet copied, but when, we also need to delete them in the link and unlink steps
-   [ ] There is probably an unclear state, because we do not yet use `-backup` yet
-   [ ] For the shell script, we also need to check if `-original` and `-backup` are correct
