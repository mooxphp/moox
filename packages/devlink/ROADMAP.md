# Roadmap

## Current tasks

-   [ ] Private packages are not yet handled (copied and wired with path)
-   [ ] Need to delete private packages in the link and unlink steps then
-   [ ] There is probably an unclear state, because we do not yet use `-backup` yet
-   [ ] For the shell script, we also need to check if `-original` and `-backup` are correct
