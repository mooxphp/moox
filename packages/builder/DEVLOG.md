# Moox Builder Devlog

This is the current state of the Builder:

- Moox Builder is currently a GitHub Template Repository (will be removed) and partly working as an installed package (will be the future)
- The current state is in this branch: https://github.com/mooxphp/moox/tree/feature/tag
- The `php artisan builder:create`command is working, tested with simple and published item yet
- A Panel is available to Preview: https://moox.test/builder
- There are 5 test entities in the package
  - https://moox.test/moox/simple-items
  - https://moox.test/moox/publishable-items
  - https://moox.test/moox/full-items
  - https://moox.test/moox/simple-taxonomies
  - https://moox.test/moox/nested-taxonomies
- The current Task is finishing these as Presets for Builder, and ...

## Todo

- [ ] The create command is not 100% as described in README
- [ ] The delete command is just partly working (not deleteing the plugin and migration) and not as described in README
- [ ] The migration created does not have a timestamp, should it be prefixed?
- [ ] The create command does not migrate, throws an error
- [ ] Some of the Blocks are not working as they miss traits, methods ... need to iterate
- [ ] Moox Core Features need to be refactored to be able to generate them without issues, eliminate methods and move to traits
  - [ ] getResourceName should be auto detected
  - [ ] Currently new Packages need to register in core to use TranslatableConfig, that was not my best idea
- [ ] We need to generate packages
  - [ ] Skeleton files
  - [ ] Generators
  - [ ] Commands
  - [ ] Package Manager first iteration using Composer commands
- [ ] We need to generate the config for entities and packages to get everything working, also set Taxonomies and Relations (not implemented yet)
- [ ] Builder needs to be cleaned up after able to generate packages
  - [ ] Cleanup config
  - [ ] Remove old entities
  - [ ] Remove build.php
  - [ ] Remove GH Template
- [ ] We need to generate factories from blocks to entities
- [ ] We need to generate tests
- [ ] Generate the Builder UI, let Builder build itself
- [ ] Generate a Frontend
- [ ] Just an idea: https://docs.larallama.io/
- [ ] Just an idea: https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser

## Todo in Core

- Publish
	- Publish Button is shown on already published items
	- Should then be save only
	- There could be a create new draft for published?
- Core Docs
	- Naming convention InModel InResource InPages and Single for single-use traits
	- TabsInResource - contains TODO
	- TabsInPage - just getTabs needs to be defined
	- TaxonomyInPages - needs that mount method in ViewPage
	- AuthorInModel
	- AuthorInResource
	- StatusInModel
	- StatusInResource - WIP
	- Links to builder or builder doc inside
- Category / Tag Docs
	- Provides a powerful hierarchical Category system, based on Nested Set and highly configurable Filament resources to build.
	- https://github.com/lazychaser/laravel-nestedset
	- https://github.com/CodeWithDennis/filament-select-tree, does need `php artisan filament:assets 
	- Screens
	- Usage / Config
- Remove commented code in build.php
- $livewire->saveAndCreateAnother(); error, auch in Tags und Builder?
- Relationships - in builder but like taxonomies
- Add fields and features: https://chatgpt.com/c/67180a73-d4e8-800c-b37a-0fa822555a11
- Meta, see "add fields and features Chat" for JSON, EAV, Polymorphic or [Spatie](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-schemaless-attributes) , currently tending to JSON + Polymorphic
- Eloquent/Builder becomes Eloquent/Tag ... Resource and Edit
- "moox/core": "*" ... version in builder should not be set?
- workbench as build?
- HasSlug has been removed from the model, as long as Moox Slug is not ready, dependency to Spatie slug is where to do?
- Item could show last changed etc. on the left ...
- Gallery images should be sortable
- Bulk restore does not work
- Set indices for slug etc, or not?
- not Cascade (for taxonomies) specially? Cascade is most of the times not a good idea, configurable?
-  If plugin data-language -> migration create_languages_table -> 
	  SP: ->hasMigration('create_data_languages_table') (correct the -)
	- Install Script like Breezy - https://github.com/jeffgreco13/filament-breezy/blob/2.x/src/Commands/Install.php
	- Model BuilderItem -> table builder_items (plural!)
