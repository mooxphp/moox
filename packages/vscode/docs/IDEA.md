# Idea

Extension Pack, could be much better:

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adrolli.tallui-laravel-livewire-tailwind

-   [ ] Remove Intelephense, it is getting more annoying every day!
-   [ ] Test DevSense IntelliPHP ...
-   [ ] XML editor fehlt
-   [ ] Laravel Intelephense or Laraphense testing since 23. Aug.
-   [ ] Laravel Extra Intellisense throws lots of errors
-   [ ] Composer Intelephense since 23. Aug.
-   [ ] Seems you removed PHP Sniffer & Beautifier
-   [ ] Seems you are not using a lot of extensions, clean up

Config und Keybindings mitliefern ... nicht nur für VS Code sondern auch für Codium wie z. B. Cursor!
