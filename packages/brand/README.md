# Moox Brand

Welcome to the official Moox brand package ‚Äî find our logo, signet, banners and information here.

This is a Laravel package that also ships every kind of image or blade components to be used on the Moox website, demo or any other Laravel platform that needs Moox branding.

## Installation

Moox Brand will automatically be installed with Moox Core and every other package that needs our identity.

Installing Moox is as easy as:

```bash
composer require moox/brand
php artisan moox:install
```

## The Moox Brand

**Moox** is:

-   A short `.org` domain I (Alf) registered 20 years ago to build something awesome

-   Besides **moox.org**, we also own **moox.de**, **moox.pro** and **moox.press**

-   A once-popular TYPO3 extension set, developed by me and my former company DCN

-   A name that works great with tech terms (e.g. _Moox Blog_, _Moox News_, _Moox Builder_)

-   A verb in the making (‚ÄúLet me moox your website‚Äù)

We write **Moox**, not ~~moox~~, not ~~MOOX~~, even if the logo does it wrong ;-)

## The Moox Logo

Our logo is the infinity symbol ‚Äî simple, memorable, and hinting at future-proof flexibility.

It looks perfect on dark blue and plays well with bright backgrounds even snow white.

    <br>
    <img src="./public/logo/moox-logo.png" width="200" alt="Moox Logo">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

It can lose color (remember fax?) without losing its identity.

    <img src="./public/logo/moox-logo-monochrome.png" width="200" alt="Moox Logo">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

_"How does infinity fit Moox? We‚Äôll know in a few decades."_ üòâ

## The Moox Signet

The Moox Signet works on dark and light backgrounds.

<p align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="./public/signet/signet.png" width="200" alt="Moox">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

We have an alternative version for special purposes.

<p align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="./public/signet/signet-alt.png" width="200" alt="Moox">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

When used as avatar image, we include the blue gradient background.

<p align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="./public/signet/avatar-on-blue.jpg" width="200" alt="Moox">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

Or if you really need a white background.

    <br>
    <img src="./public/signet/avatar-on-white.jpg" width="200" alt="Moox">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

## The Moox Banner

All our packages have a consistent banner ‚Äî useful for fast visual context.

-   Primary size: **2560√ó1440**
-   Required by: [filamentphp.com](https://filamentphp.com/)
-   Compatible with: GitHub, Packagist, VS Code, and beyond
-   See the example in this README.md or in any other package.

## Moox ASCII Art

For Artisan commands (and others) we use ASCII Art that ships with a trait in this package.

```php
<?php

namespace Moox\Brand\Console\Traits;

use function Laravel\Prompts\info;

trait Art
{
    public function art(): void
    {
        info('

						Weird looking code, nice ASCII art, we sware! ;-)

        ');
    }
}

```

## The Moox Bot

Moox Bot is the identity of our GitHub Bot and he is always around, when browsing Moox.org. He is a nice and helpful robot.

He is used as Avatar:

<p align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="./public/robot/mooxbot-avatar.jpg" width="200" alt="Moox">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

Or flying around:

<p align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="./public/robot/2-attention.png" width="200" alt="Moox">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

Sometimes hiding:

<p align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="./public/robot/80-box.png" width="200" alt="Moox">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>
