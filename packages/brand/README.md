# Moox Brand

Welcome to the official Moox brand package ‚Äî find our logo, signet, banners and information here.

This is a Laravel package that also ships every kind of image or blade components to be used on the Moox website, demo or any other Laravel platform that needs Moox branding.

## Installation

Coming soon ...

## The Moox Brand

**Moox** is:

-   A short `.org` domain I (Alf) registered 20 years ago to build something awesome

-   Besides **moox.org**, we also own **moox.de**, **moox.pro** and **moox.press**

-   A once-popular TYPO3 extension set, developed by me and my former company DCN

-   A name that works great with tech terms (e.g. _Moox Blog_, _Moox News_, _Moox Builder_)

-   A verb in the making (‚ÄúLet me moox your website‚Äù)

We write **Moox**, not ~~moox~~, not ~~MOOX~~, even if the logo does it wrong ;-)

## Our Moox Logo

Our logo is the infinity symbol ‚Äî simple, memorable, and hinting at future-proof flexibility.

It looks perfect on dark blue and plays well with bright backgrounds even snow white.

    <img src="./public/logo/moox-logo.png" width="200" alt="Moox Logo">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

It can lose color (remember fax?) without losing its identity.

    <br>
</p>

_"How does infinity fit Moox? We‚Äôll know in a few decades."_ üòâ

## The Moox Signet

The Moox Signet works on dark and light backgrounds.

    <img src="./public/signet/signet.png" width="200" alt="Moox">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

We have an alternative version for special purposes.

<p align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="./public/signet/signet-alt.png" width="200" alt="Moox">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

When used as avatar image, we include the blue gradient background.

<p align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="./public/signet/avatar-on-blue.jpg" width="200" alt="Moox">
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

Or if you really need a white background.

    <br>

## Moox ASCII Art

For Artisan commands (and others) we use ASCII Art ... more coming soon ...

## Moox Screenshots

Our screenshots should use the Moox Screenshot Mockup. Please take care of not leaking private data. We probably use short animated GIF videos instead of static JPEGs.

## The Moox Bot

Moox Bot is the identity of our GitHub Bot and he is always around, when browsing Moox.org. He is a nice and helpful robot.

## Our Moox Colors

We haven't defined the colors exactly as we only use them as gradients but those are picked from our logo and banner:

-   **Violet:** #600ab1
-   **Pink:** #860c94
-   **Dark-blue:** #01081b
-   **Gradient-to:** #190fd6

## Our Moox Fonts

- The Moox logo uses **Exo Soft**
- Our website and Admin Panels use **Exo 2**
- For documentation we use **Noto Sans** 
- For code we use **Noto Sans Mono**
- Headings should be kept in **Exo 2** or **Exo** 
- All fonts are available on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
