## Usage

<!-- Usage -->

### Output the BPMN viewer

```php
<x-bpmn-viewer media-id="123" mode="edit" />
<x-bpmn-viewer wp-media-id="456" mode="view" />
<x-bpmn-viewer file-path="/path/to/file.bpmn" mode="both" />
```

-   `media_id` works with Moox Media as well as Spatie Media Library
-   `wp_media_id` works with Moox Press, means WordPress Media Library
-   `file_path` works with all other files

The `mode` attribute can be

-   `edit` what means the BPMN file can be viewed and edited
-   `view` what means the BPMN file can be viewed

### Use the Filament field

```php
BpmnViewer::make('bpmn')
    ->label(__('BPMN Process'))
    ->mediaIntegration('moox')
    ->mode('edit')
    ->required(),
```

The `mediaIntegration` can be

-   `moox` works with Moox Media as well as Spatie Media Library
-   `press` works with Moox Press, means WordPress Media Library
-   `file` is the default setting, means it saves it directly to the default disk

and `filePath`can set a specific path only used for the `file`-integration.

The `mode` can be

-   `edit` what means the BPMN file can be edited in Filament
-   `upload` what means the BPMN file can just be uploaded and previewed
-   `full` is the default setting, what means upload or create and edit
