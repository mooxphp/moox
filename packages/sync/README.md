# Moox Sync

Moox Sync is under hard development.

Moox Sync enables you to synchronize records between Moox platforms or other Filament and Laravel platforms.

## Manage Platforms

First, you need to create a platform, better two. Even if you would be able to sync on the same platform (but different model), that is not the main idea of Sync.

There are two Filament Resource to manage Platforms and Syncs.

## Manage Syncs

Then you are able to create a Sync between platforms. Choose source and target platform and model, add parameters, sync.

## How Sync works

Here are some key components and the basic flow of Sync:

-   **Moox Sync API**

    -   `Platforms`: Manage and retrieve platform configurations.
    -   `Syncs`: Manage sync configurations, including CRUD operations for sync setups.
    -   `Syncs for Platform`: Retrieve sync configurations specific to a platform. This API is essential for the -  -   `SyncApiJob` to query the latest sync configurations.

-   **SyncApiJob**

    -   Periodically (or on-demand) fetch sync configurations from the Moox Sync API to ensure that the latest sync rules are applied.
    -   Flow:
        -   Triggered based on a defined schedule or event.
        -   Queries the Moox Sync API for sync configurations related to a specific platform.
        -   Refreshes the local sync table to reflect the latest sync setups.

-   **SyncListener**

    -   Monitor model events (e.g., create, update, delete) on the source platform.
    -   Flow:
        -   Attached to models specified in the sync configuration.
        -   When an event occurs (e.g., a new record is created), the listener triggers.
        -   The listener then invokes a Webhook on the target platform by sending the relevant data (e.g., model data) through an HTTP request to the `SyncWebhook`.

-   **SyncWebhook**

    -   Act as the entry point on the target platform, receiving data from the source platform via the `SyncListener`.
    -   Flow:
        -   Receives the data from the source platform.
        -   Validates the incoming data and checks for any transformation or field mapping requirements specified in the sync configuration.
        -   Triggers the `SyncJob` with the validated and transformed data.

-    **SyncJob**

    -   Perform the actual data synchronization on the target platform.
    -   Flow:
        -   Executes the query on the target platform to create, update, or delete records based on the data received from the source platform.
        -   Handles conditions like conflict resolution (e.g., updating existing records if they match certain criteria).
        -   Logs success or failure, including error handling (e.g., retry logic if the sync fails due to temporary issues).

-   **Sync Backup Job**

    -   To ensure data consistency even when changes are made outside of Eloquent events, you can use the SyncBackupJob. This job compares and updates data based on your sync configurations.
    
    ```bash
    php artisan sync:backup
    ```


## Quick Installation

These two commmands are all you need to install the package:

```bash
composer require moox/sync
php artisan mooxsync:install
```

Curious what the install command does? See manual installation below.

## Manual Installation

Instead of using the install-command `php artisan mooxsync:install` you are able to install this package manually step by step:

```bash
// Publish and run the migrations:
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="sync-migrations"
php artisan migrate

// Publish the config file with:
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="sync-config"
```
