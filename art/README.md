# Moox Art

Here is the place to find our logo, signet, screenshots and banners as well as information about our identity.

## Moox Brand

Moox is a random word that:

-   was a short .org domain I registered 20 years ago
-   was a popular set of TYPO3 Extensions about 10 years ago
-   sound good combined with techy words, try "Moox Blog"
-   can be used like "google", try "let me moox your website"

## Moox Logo

The Moox Logo is infinitey, so it looks nice and is easy to remember.
How infinity fits Moox? We will see in some decades ;-)

## Moox Banner

There are banners for every package we build. They are primarily useful for getting a first glance on the package.
They are rendered on GitHub and Moox.org as well as third party platforms like VS Code Marketplace and Filament.
The banner sizes are 1280 by 640 pixels.

## Moox Screenshot

Our screenshots should use the Moox Screenshot Mockup. Please take care of not leaking private data.

## Moox Bot

Moox Bot is the identity of our GitHub Bot. There are maybe more things, Moox Bot can do in the future ;-)

## Moox Colors

Our brand colors are currently not defined. You can pick the pink and violet from the logo or the banner images.

## Moox Fonts

Our fonts are currently not defined. The logo is based on Exo Soft.
