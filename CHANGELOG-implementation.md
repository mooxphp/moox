# Changelog

This is the changelog of the Moox monorepo. All changes noted here are used to update the changelogs of the individual packages and will invoke a new release for all packages that have changes or all packages if a mayor version is released.

## Next

This is the next version that will be released. We need to just skip this part of the changelog to get to the current version.

### All

Skip this too.

### Core

And this too.

## 4.0.0

This is the current version. If this is newer than the already released version, the changelog should be updated and a new release should be created.

This comment stays only here in the monorepo changelog.

### All

This should be written to all Moox packages.

-   Added support for Filament 4
-   Removed support for Filament 3
-   Aligned all Moox packages to Version 4.0
-   Added automatic changelog generation

### Core

This would be written to the core package instead of the all-packages changelog.

### Press

This would be written to the Press package instead of the all-packages changelog.

And so on.

If All is empty, and the package is not mentioned in the changelog but has updates, there should be a "Compatibility release" note written the changelog of the package.
